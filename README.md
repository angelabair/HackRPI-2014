#GENERAL OVERVIEW#
#################

Coat For Arms®©™ is the internet's premier weather and daily life advisement service. Based on a set of rigorously determined user preferences,
the program will determine the ideal attire for each individual. Our heavily researched mathematical algorithm determines when certain outfits are 
appropriate, based on the temperature and weather outside, while also factoring in the predetermined user preferences. Coat For Arms was developed 
with JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3, Google Geolocator API, OpenWeather API and a node.js backend using a MongoDB Database hosted on a Heroku server.

#USAGE#
#######

Once a user has created their account, they will be asked a set of preliminary questions to determine their preferences. Once their account is 
operational, the user can input any location, which will then be handled by the Geolocator API. Once the coordinates of the location are determined, they
are passed to the OpenWeather API which returns the weather information. Our algorithm then determines the appropriate clothing recommendation
based on the user preferences for that particular user.
